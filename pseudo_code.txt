Welcome to Pseudo Code!

Create
    - ask for LRN, Student Name, Age, etc. using <form> and <input> .
    - check if LRN data is already exsisting 
        - if yes :
            - warn the user
            - show them the data connected to the LRN instead. (redirect to search.html)
        - if no :
            - store data to Local Storage

Read
    - ask for LRN using <input>
        - if LRN exsist in the database :
            - display the student data connected to the LRN
        - if LRN doesn't exsist in the database ;
            - warn the user
            - ask to create a new student data instead (redirect to create.html)

Update
    - ask for LRN using <input>
        - if LRN exsist in the database :

            - tell the user the action is irreversable, then ask to continue or go back.
                - if continue :
                    - move the data connected to the LRN to a separate branch in the Local Storage or mark as deleted or smth (still figuring this out)
                - if go back :
                    - break
